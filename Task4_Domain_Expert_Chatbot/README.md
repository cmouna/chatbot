# Task 4 - Domain Expert Chatbot
# 📚 ArXiv Expert Chatbot

## Overview

ArXiv Expert Chatbot is an AI-powered research assistant designed to help users explore Computer Science research papers from the arXiv repository. The system combines semantic search, research paper retrieval, summarization, question answering, information extraction, and visualization techniques to provide an interactive research experience.

The chatbot leverages Sentence Transformers for semantic retrieval, Ollama with Gemma 2B for intelligent responses, and Streamlit for the user interface.

## Features

### Semantic Research Search

* Retrieve relevant research papers using semantic similarity.
* Search across thousands of Computer Science papers from arXiv.

### Research Paper Summarization

* Generate concise summaries of retrieved papers.
* Highlight research objectives, methodology, key findings, and significance.

### Expert Question Answering

* Answer research-related questions using retrieved paper content.
* Maintain conversation context during the session.

### Information Extraction

Automatically extracts:

* Methods
* Datasets
* Evaluation Metrics

from retrieved research papers.

### Word Cloud Visualization

* Generate visual representations of frequently occurring research concepts.

### Concept Graph Visualization

* Visualize relationships between methods, datasets, and performance metrics.

### Session Memory

* Store recent user interactions for context-aware responses.
