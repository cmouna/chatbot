# Dynamic Knowledge Base Chatbot

## Project Overview

The Dynamic Knowledge Base Chatbot is an AI-powered document retrieval system that automatically expands its knowledge base whenever new documents are added. The project utilizes Chroma Vector Database and Hugging Face Sentence Transformers to perform semantic search over uploaded TXT and PDF documents.

The chatbot continuously updates its vector database and retrieves relevant information based on user queries, fulfilling the objective of dynamic knowledge base expansion.

## Workflow

1. Documents are stored inside the documents folder.
2. The ingestion module loads TXT and PDF files.
3. Documents are divided into chunks using recursive text splitting.
4. Embeddings are generated using Sentence Transformers.
5. Chunks are stored in Chroma Vector Database.
6. User queries are converted into embeddings.
7. Similarity search retrieves the most relevant content.
8. The chatbot returns the answer along with source information and confidence score.

## Installation

### Clone Repository

git clone <repository-url>

cd Dynamic-Knowledge-Base-Chatbot

### Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

---

## Build the Knowledge Base

python ingest.py

This creates the vector database from all documents inside the documents folder.

---

## Run Automatic Updater

python updater.py

The updater continuously monitors the documents directory and updates the vector database whenever files are added or modified.
