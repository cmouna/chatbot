# Task -1 Dynamic Knowledge Base Chatbot

## Introduction

This internship task focused on developing a Dynamic Knowledge Base Chatbot capable of learning from uploaded documents and retrieving relevant information in response to user queries. The project was designed to demonstrate the practical application of Natural Language Processing (NLP), document embeddings, vector databases, and information retrieval techniques.

## Background

Modern organizations generate large amounts of textual information that can be difficult to access efficiently. Traditional search methods often require manual browsing through documents. To address this challenge, a dynamic chatbot was developed that automatically indexes uploaded files and retrieves relevant content based on user questions. The chatbot supports TXT and PDF documents and updates its knowledge base whenever new files are added.

## Learning Objectives

The primary objectives of this task were:

* Understand the fundamentals of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.
* Learn document processing and text chunking techniques.
* Implement semantic search using embeddings.
* Build and manage a vector database using ChromaDB.
* Develop an interactive chatbot interface using Streamlit.
* Gain experience with dynamic document ingestion and automated knowledge base updates.

## Activities and Tasks

The following activities were completed during the project:

1. Designed the overall architecture of the Dynamic Knowledge Base Chatbot.
2. Implemented document ingestion for TXT and PDF files.
3. Applied text chunking using Recursive Character Text Splitter.
4. Generated vector embeddings using Sentence Transformers.
5. Stored and managed embeddings in a Chroma vector database.
6. Developed a retrieval mechanism to find relevant document chunks.
7. Implemented confidence scoring for retrieved results.
8. Created a Streamlit-based user interface for document upload and chatbot interaction.
9. Developed an updater module to automatically detect document changes and update the knowledge base.
10. Tested the chatbot using multiple AI and technology-related datasets.

## Feedback and Evidence

The chatbot successfully demonstrated the ability to:

* Learn from uploaded documents.
* Retrieve contextually relevant information.
* Display source references for retrieved answers.
* Dynamically update the knowledge base when documents were modified.
* Handle multiple document sources within a unified interface.

Testing confirmed that queries related to uploaded AI and technology topics returned accurate and relevant responses with confidence scores.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Dependency Compatibility Issues

Different LangChain versions introduced import and compatibility problems.

**Solution:** Updated the project to use supported LangChain integrations and replaced deprecated modules where necessary.

### Challenge 2: Vector Database File Locking

The Chroma database occasionally remained locked during updates.

**Solution:** Modified the ingestion process to avoid deleting active database files and implemented safer update mechanisms.

### Challenge 3: Inconsistent Retrieval Quality

Some documents returned incomplete or mixed responses due to chunking issues.

**Solution:** Improved document formatting and adjusted chunk size and overlap parameters to produce more meaningful retrieval results.

### Challenge 4: Low Confidence Responses

Irrelevant responses occasionally appeared for unknown queries.

**Solution:** Implemented confidence thresholds to filter weak matches and return a "No relevant information found" message when appropriate.

## Outcomes and Impact

The project resulted in a fully functional Dynamic Knowledge Base Chatbot capable of:

* Processing uploaded TXT and PDF documents.
* Creating and maintaining a searchable knowledge base.
* Retrieving relevant information using semantic similarity search.
* Providing confidence-based responses.
* Supporting dynamic updates without rebuilding the entire system.

The solution demonstrates practical applications of NLP and information retrieval systems and can be extended for enterprise knowledge management, document assistance, and educational support systems.

## Conclusion

The Dynamic Knowledge Base Chatbot project successfully achieved its objectives by combining document processing, vector embeddings, semantic search, and an interactive user interface into a single application. The task provided valuable hands-on experience in NLP, retrieval systems, and chatbot development. The final system effectively demonstrates how AI-driven document retrieval can improve access to information and support intelligent question-answering applications.
