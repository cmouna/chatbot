# Task-2 Multi-Modal AI Assistant

## Introduction

This project focuses on the development of a Multi-Modal AI Assistant capable of understanding and reasoning over both image and text inputs. The assistant analyzes uploaded images, extracts textual information, maintains conversational context, and generates evidence-based responses. The system was developed using Python, Streamlit, BLIP image captioning, and EasyOCR technologies.

## Feedback and Evidence

The developed system successfully generated image captions, extracted text from visual content, and answered user questions based on image evidence. Testing demonstrated the assistant's ability to maintain conversational context, provide explainable responses, and support evidence-based reasoning. Screenshots of application outputs and successful test cases serve as evidence of project completion and functionality.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: OCR Input Compatibility

EasyOCR initially produced input format errors when processing uploaded images.

**Solution:** Converted PIL images into NumPy arrays before OCR processing, ensuring compatibility with EasyOCR requirements.

### Challenge 2: Context-Aware Responses

Early versions provided generic answers without considering previous interactions.

**Solution:** Implemented session-based conversation memory to maintain context across multiple user queries.

### Challenge 3: Evidence-Based Reasoning

Initial responses lacked transparency and justification.

**Solution:** Added supporting evidence panels and reasoning process visualization to explain how answers were generated.
