# Task 6 - Multilingual Chatbot 
# 🌍 Advanced Multilingual Chatbot

## Introduction

The objective of this internship task was to develop an Advanced Multilingual Chatbot capable of supporting conversations across multiple languages while preserving context, intent, and conversational continuity. The chatbot was designed to automatically detect user languages, manage language switches, maintain conversation memory, and provide intelligent responses using open-source language models and natural language processing techniques.

## Background

With the increasing demand for global communication, multilingual conversational systems have become an important area of artificial intelligence. Traditional chatbots often struggle to maintain context when users switch languages during a conversation. This project addresses these challenges by integrating language detection, translation services, conversational memory, and open-source large language models to deliver a seamless multilingual user experience.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Incorrect Language Detection

Short single-word inputs were occasionally misclassified by the language detection library.

**Solution:**
Custom logic was introduced to improve detection accuracy for short English inputs.

### Challenge 2: Maintaining Context Across Languages

The chatbot initially struggled to recall information when users switched languages.

**Solution:**
Conversation history was translated into a common language and supplied as contextual memory to the language model.

### Challenge 3: Ambiguous Queries

Certain terms such as "Apple" and "Python" could have multiple meanings.

**Solution:**
An ambiguity handling module was implemented to request clarification before generating responses.

## Outcomes and Impact

The final chatbot successfully achieved the intended objectives by:

* Supporting multilingual conversations across multiple languages.
* Preserving context and conversational continuity.
* Demonstrating cross-lingual reasoning capabilities.
* Automatically detecting and responding in the user's language.
* Handling ambiguous queries intelligently.
* Utilizing open-source AI technologies for response generation.

The project demonstrates the practical application of conversational AI and multilingual NLP techniques in creating user-friendly and context-aware virtual assistants.
