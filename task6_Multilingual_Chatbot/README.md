# Task 6 - Multilingual Chatbot 
# 🌍 Advanced Multilingual Chatbot

## Overview

The Advanced Multilingual Chatbot is an AI-powered conversational assistant designed to support multilingual interactions while preserving context, intent, and conversational continuity across language switches.

The system automatically detects the user's language, translates inputs to a common processing language, maintains conversation memory, performs cross-lingual reasoning, and returns responses in the user's preferred language. It also handles ambiguous queries through clarification prompts and supports multilingual conversations using open-source AI models.
